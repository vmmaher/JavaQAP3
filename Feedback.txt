1. How many hours did it take you to complete this assessment?
It took about 3 1/2 hours
 
2. What online resources you have used?
None were needed
 
3. Did you need to ask any of your friends in solving the problems.
No, I didn't need to
 
4. Did you need to ask questions to any of your instructors?
No, I didn't need to
 
5. Rate (subjectively) the difficulty of each question from your own perspective, and 
whether you feel confident that you can solve a similar but different problem requiring 
some of the same techniques in the future now that youâ€™ve completed this one.
The difficulty of this assignment was simple but the extensive math formulas made it take a lot of
time for me to implement even though I understand the material well.
